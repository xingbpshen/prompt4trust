pip install -r requirements.txt
```
### 1.2 Download dataset
Create a `data/` folder under the project root:
```bash
cd vccrl-llm/
mkdir data/
```
Download the dataset from the MedMCQA repository [here](https://drive.google.com/uc?export=download&id=15VkJdq5eyWIkfb_aoD3oS8i4tScbHYky). Unzip and put all three `.json` files in the newly created `data/` folder.
